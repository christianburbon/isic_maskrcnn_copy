## ISICs 2018 Leison Segmentation using Mask R-CNN

This project uses [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) to predict lesion segmentation boundaries within dermoscopic images [ISIC 2018 Challenge - Task 1: Lesion Boundary Segmentation](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/landing/2018/45/). Mask-RCNN is an extension of [Faster R-CNN](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2015/file/14bfa6bb14875e45bba028a21ed38046-Paper.pdf) where it also uses a region proposal network (RPN) that proposes candidate bounding boxes at the first stage, and modifies the second stage where the same RoIPool is used to extract features then adds a parallel generates an output for each RoI [1]. Mask R-CNN optimizes the three (3) loss functions for each ROI namely, classification loss (_Lcls_), bounding-box class loss (_Lbox_), and mask loss (_Lmask_). The total loss is defined as _L = Lcls + Lbox + Lmask_.
